        <h1>Who is Glitters?</h1>
        <p>We’re a small but passionate team of writers, creators, and thinkers who love discovering beauty in the everyday.
        Glitters was born from the simple idea that inspiration can come from anywhere — a city street, a cup of coffee, a song
        lyric, or a conversation with a friend.</p>
        <h1>Why Glitters?</h1>
        <p>Because not everything that shines has to be loud. Sometimes the quietest moments sparkle the most. "Glitters" is about
        finding those subtle, beautiful details and celebrating them with words.</p>
